# CAD Files

3D CAD models for the Sesame Robot Project. Files are formatted in STEP format and F360 format.

Looking for STLs for 3D printing? See [printing](../printing/README.md).

>[!CAUTION]
> Parametric drawings and tools made in the original design files may not properly translate to your system. You may need to re-design certain components if you are making significant size changes.

## Editing the CAD with Free Tools

You do not need a paid CAD suite to remix Sesame’s parts. A few practical workflows:

1. **Fusion 360 personal license** – Autodesk offers a free hobbyist tier that can open the native `.f3d` files. Enable the *Design History* timeline to see how assemblies were built before changing dimensions.
2. **FreeCAD for STEP tweaks** – All parts are exported as `.step`, so you can import them into FreeCAD, adjust sketches, and re-export STL/STEP files without losing references. Use the *Part Design* workbench for parametric edits.
3. **Onshape education account** – Onshape’s free plan lets you upload the STEP files and edit directly in-browser. Great for Chromebook users or when collaborating in real time.
4. **Meshmixer/Blender for quick mods** – If you just need to shave openings or add text, import the STL into Meshmixer or Blender, make the change, and re-export. This is faster for cosmetic tweaks, but stick with the parametric source for anything dimension-critical.

> [!TIP]
> Keep the original STEP/ Fusion file untouched and branch your edits into a copy. That way you can always rebase onto the upstream design if new hardware revisions ship.

## Generated parts

The Aurora head (round AMOLED head shell and its top cover) is not in the Fusion file. It is generated from the No-Ears cover STL by [`aurora-head/generate_aurora_head.py`](aurora-head/generate_aurora_head.py); see [printing/stl/top-covers/aurora-head](../printing/stl/top-covers/aurora-head/README.md).
